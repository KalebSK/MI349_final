                <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
                <p>MSU Valorant is a club run at Michigan State University for the video game
                Valorant by game developer Riot Games. Valorant is known in the gaming world as a tactical
                first person shooter where players must work together in order to win more rounds than
                their opponents. MSU Valorant is a club for all people at the University and surrounding areas who want to discuss
                and enjoy their passion for the game. The club hosts multiple events every semester including bi-weekly in person meetings
                at a local LAN center (a place with many gaming PCs that are usable for playing Valorant) where new friendships are born over the
                enjoyment of our favorite game Valorant.
